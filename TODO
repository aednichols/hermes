1.0 Priorities

1) Better unit test coverage
2) Fix the grammars in the 'bugs' directory
3) Make python parser raise exception rather than return exception
4) Fix bug with not being able to run the 'generate' or 'parse' commands without being in the project root (can't find the template file)
5) Run all the examples in the documentation, make sure output is exactly right.
6) Change display of analyze command:
    a) Make terminals and nonterminals print out in the case they are in the grammar file
    b) Remove Îµ from terminal list if not used in grammar
7) Fix error in generated parser if a specified token does not exist.  Current message is a bit cryptic.
8) Remove the first and follow sets for list macros.
9) In j.zgr, if no tokens are given, we don't get an empty parse tree as we'd expect
10) rename tmpx to _genx
11) in analyze, display all items in order of their ids, ascending.
12) Change 'tokens' in binding_power to 'terminals'
